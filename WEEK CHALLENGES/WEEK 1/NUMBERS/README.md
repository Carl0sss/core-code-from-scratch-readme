# Numbers
```
1. Ask for the number you need to verify and call it 'number_to_verify'
2. If a number is even you are able to divide it into 2 with no decimals (e.g. 10/2 = 5)
3. Verify if 'number_to_verify' can be divided by 2
4. If it can be divided then:
4.1 Print that 'number_to_verify' is even
5. If it cannot be divided exactly by 2, then:
5.1 Print that 'number_to_verify' is odd
End
```
