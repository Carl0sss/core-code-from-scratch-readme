# Geometry
```
1. Ask which volume is required (cube, pyramid or sphere)
2. If we need a cube then:
2.1 Ask the length of one side
2.2 Since it is supposed to be the same in the three sides, the volume is: volume = side _ side _ side or volume = side^3
2.3 Print the value calculated, in this case would be: 'volume'
3. If we need a sphere then:
3.1 Ask the length of the radius
3.2 The value of the volume is: 4/3 _ pi _ r^3
3.3 Print the value of the volume
4. If we need a pyramid then:
4.1 Ask the length of the base and call it 'baselength'
4.2 Ask the width of the base and call it 'base_width'
4.3 Ask the height of the pyramid and call it 'height'
4.4 The value of the volume is defined as: 1/3 * baselength * base_width * height
4.5 Print the value of the volume
End
